## Goodhart's Law
When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
Goodhart's law is named after economist Charles Goodhart, paraphrasing: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." 
The original formulation by Goodhart is this: "As soon as the government attempts to regulate any particular set of financial assets, these become unreliable as indicators of economic trends."
